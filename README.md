# Bored-Adventurer-DEMO
This is a short console ASCII turn-based roguelite game I've made to practice the fundamentals of C/C++, and to learn to use PDCurses, a terminal manipulation library.

I'm making it open source under MIT so anyone can use it to learn the really basics of C/C++, or the PDCurses library.
